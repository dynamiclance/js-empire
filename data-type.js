    The data type of NaN is number ||

    The data type of an undefined variable is undefined *
    The data type of a variable that has not been assigned a value is also undefined *

// Note: The typeof operator returns "object" for arrays because in JavaScript arrays are objects.
// Note: the typeof operator always returns a string (containing the type of the operand).

// Undefined || In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
// Null ||  In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist. || Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.

/* 
Difference Between Undefined and Null
undefined and null are equal in value but different in type:

    typeof undefined           // undefined
    typeof null                // object

    null === undefined         // false
    null == undefined          // true
